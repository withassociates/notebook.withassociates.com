## Review

- **Marie & The Extraordinary Glass Bottles**  
  We still agree that Marie and Mathew will pair this into a complete article, to be posted on Medium.
- **Tom’s Considerate CSS**  
  Tom was positive about Jamie’s outline. They’ll find a moment to pair when Tom’s back from holiday.
- **Ben and Erin’s Heroku Review Apps**  
  Let’s look at doing an experience report.
- **Ben’s Snippets of Usefulness**  
  There are some good examples ripe to captured, mainly the Gemfile thing. Let’s stick them in this repo (withassociates.github.io).
- **Dictaphone Conversations**  
  Anna and Mathew did a dictaphone conversation but needs transcribing and editing.
- **Nini’s Design Typologies**  
  Anna mentioned to Nini a DC. Keep on backburner, thinking of ways to help.
- **David’s Payment Systems Study**  
  Planning visually. Based around points of interest within screenshot flow. Maybe start with mechanically taking screenshots.
- **DConstruct**  
  Dictaphone conversation.
- **Let me automate that for you**  
  We’ve tweeted and haven’t received any submissions yet. Let’s put some examples on the webpage. Great content from Tim. XKCD strip about automation.
- **Mathew’s piece on Temporary Deletion of Apps you Want to Ignore**  
 Mathew wants Anna to edit these pieces.

## New Ideas

- **Anna’s Book Club**  
  Marie, Mathew and Anna have all read the same book. Book club chat thing. Real life comments. Maybe do a “what is it you want to read?” session.
- **Articles about the web from 10 years ago**
- **Explorations of before/moment/after for things/concepts we take for granted**
  - Planning permission
  - Multi touch
  - Inflation
- **Do One Thing**  
  Produce these things as a group, one at a time.
