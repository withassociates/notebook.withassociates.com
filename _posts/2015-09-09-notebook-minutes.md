## Review

- **Marie & The Extraordinary Glass Bottles**  
  We still agree that Marie and Mathew will pair this into a complete article, to be posted on Medium.
- **Tom’s Considerate CSS**  
  Tom was positive about Jamie’s outline. They’ll find a moment to pair when Tom’s back from holiday.
- **Ben and Erin’s Heroku Review Apps**  
  Heroku’s own docs cover it pretty well but maybe there’s an article about workflow in there somewhere.
- **Ben’s Snippets of Usefulness**  
  Tumblr’s “Chat” type doesn’t seem ideal. The Gemfile.lock debate in plain old markdown seems like a good candidate.
- **Dictaphone Conversations**  
  Calum will have a go at teasing something out of the Phoenix transcript when time allows.
- **Nini’s Design Typologies**  
  We all like the sound of this idea and want to encourage Nini when she’s no longer With.
  We think she should definitely start that Tumblr.
- **David’s Payment Systems Study**  
  Started. David has used the recent work with client R as a lens through which to look at this problem domain.
  Analytics, Funnel tracking. David should maybe have a conversation with Al, Dan Bower.
- **DConstruct**  
  Anna is going to DConstruct. She will record her experiences in pen on paper. Someone else will digitise them.
- **A Piece About OfficeTime**  
  We’re still very early into this. Maybe one for next year.
- **Medium**
  Not much thought in this really but keep looking for examples.

## New Ideas

- **Notebook as linked list**
- **Let me automate that for you**  
  Can we help you automate a drudge task using computers? Maybe funnel into Pair?
  First step is to tweet and see what’s out there. Jamie will tweet on Monday.
- **Mathew’s piece on Temporary Deletion of Apps you Want to Ignore**  
  Spelling and copychecking standing in the way.
