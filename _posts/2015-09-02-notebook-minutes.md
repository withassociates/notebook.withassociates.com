## Marie & The Extraordinary Glass Bottles

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NRfRIk5cE86QL3YQJos14uc6NClfMn9GKMmpeZmMsg/edit

Marie has documented the research that went into attempting the
personalised glass bottle project for the studio. We all agree
it’s lovely and deserves to be up for people to see.

Mathew found an opportunity to bring up his shed fairly early on.

Calum made a joke. We tried to laugh.

Marie and Mathew are going to have a go at writing this up on
Medium.

## Tom’s Considerate CSS

https://gist.github.com/thomasmarshall/47e8c8428badbf8de7bd

We think Gist is the best canonical home for it.

Tom has some amends still to do, but we’re agreed we’d like to
make some noise about this as soon as possible.

Jamie is going to help Tom get this out.

## Ben and Erin’s Heroku Review Apps

We’re trying out Heroku Review Apps in earnest. This piece
will document those efforts.

Note: remember to add a date to the article.

- Rationale
- Step-by-step guide

## Ben’s Snippets of Usefulness

Little exchanges from pull requests.

Thoughts for how we capture these:

- Tweets
- Screenshots
- ?

@erino

> Use .any? rather then .count > 1

@calumgunn

> But that'd work for .count == 1 as well, which isn't intended

@bensymonds

> .many?

@erino

> .many??

@bensymonds

> MANY???????????????????????????

@jgwhite

> Before you do: it might be worth verifying that many? translates into a Mongo COUNT. We had this problem with Resonance. A bit of abstraction leak on Mongoid’s Criteria API.

@jsphm

> many doesn't translate into a Mongo COUNT so I'm sticking with count.

**We’ll give this a go on Tumblr to begin with.**

Ben will lead by example.

## Dictaphone Conversations

We’ve given this a go in /2015/08/12/lunch-with-phoenix.html

Record each other’s faces with Go Pro.

Calum will take a look at the “Lunch with Phoenix” piece and
see if we can editorialize it a bit.

## Nini’s Design Typologies

Short series of regular posts on a particular design problem.

First theme: Tables on mobile

A Tumblr?

## David’s Payment Systems Study

A post on Medium?

Format: question-based

Will start next week with one timeboxed hour.

## DConstruct

At least Mathew will take some photos and have some opinions.

## A Piece About OfficeTime

Why we settled on the tools we did. Why we’re changing up now.

## Medium

Can we collect our individual stuff into a collective magazine.
