### Nini’s Design Typology

Nini proposed a design typology over 3 months, defining a theme/element to
produce a series. This is an interesting potential format looking for a theme.

### Marie’s Water Bottle Debrief

Marie proposed a debrief of the water bottle trials. The format would be
a simple bulleted list, no expectation of prose, but maybe that’ll happen
by accident.

### Jamie’s Dialogues

Jamie proposed the dialogue format for a piece about Elixir.

### Tom’s CSS Article

How can we get this out and published?

### Choosing a Regular Time for Notebook Session

Nini proposed the venue for notebook sessions could be every Wednesday tea time.
